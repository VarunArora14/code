    1. getMax() - gets the root of the element
    2. extractMax() - extracts the root of the element but maintains the heap property O(log n)
    3.  Decreases value of key. The time complexity of this operation is O(Logn). 
        If the decreases key value of a node is less than the parent of the node, 
        then we don’t need to do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the
        violated heap property.
    4. insert() -  Inserting a new key takes O(Logn) time. We add a new key at the end of 
                the tree. IF new key is less than its parent, then we don’t need to do anything. 
                   Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.

    5. delete(): Deleting a key also takes O(Logn) time. We replace the key to be deleted with
                 minum infinite by calling decreaseKey(). After decreaseKey(), the minus
                  infinite value must reach root, so we call extractMin() to remove the key.

/*It checks for nodes whether greater than children and then swaps them
pseudo code is -

for(i=n/2 downto 1)
maxheapify(A,i); -> it takes O(logn)

Now the intial simple complexity may give an assumption that it takes log2N*N time but
looking at operations per node gives another analysis and values as shown below.

This functio is used for building heap which first moves from the bottom up mannner in wich 
N/2 nodes are already children so we ignore them as they are already max heaps and then move 
to level 1 from bottom which has N/4 nodes and then N/4 nodes remaining above. For those N/4
nodes N/4.1.c time takes place as 1 level so 1 swap and c is constant time.
Similarly next N/8 nodes take N/8.2.c time as 2 levels so max 2 swaps so on till 1.log2 N.c
time as root node only with logN max swapping where logN is height of the tree as we suppose
left and right subtrees are binary trees. Adding them
N/4.1.c + N/8.2.c +... 1.log2 N.c =
(assuming N/4 = 2^k)
2^k.c.(1/2^0 + 2/2^1 + 3/2^3... (k+1)/2^k) -> again k is height of tree and 2^k=N/4

Since inner series is convergent because it is in form of i=0 to n (i+1/2^i) which can be
proved converegent by induction or tests.
Since it is bounded as convergent, it has max value < 3 as first 2 terms add=2 and then next
terms value<1. So now, it has value c'.
Time complexity now is, c.2^k.c' = C.2^k where 2^k=N/4 -> O(CN) = O(N)

/*
So, now the problem boils down to the question which implementation is based for which 
type of programming languages and how they are been implemented in heaps.
Mathematicians used counting starting from 1 and so, for them the left and right parts
are given by left=2*i and right=2*i+1 as root at index 1 , left at 2, right at 3 and so on.

For many programming languages the implementation is based on root=index 0 so for them
left=2*i+1 and right=2*i+2. This is the reason for problems like infinite recursion earllier 
in this code which maybe due to bug in the implementation which did not fully solve the heap
problem. One layer of subtree 16, 4, 10, 14, 7, 9, 3, 2, 8, 1 was solved to
16, 14, 10, 4, 7, 9, 3, 2, 8, 1 but not brought to the right end which was
16, 14, 10, 8, 7, 9, 3, 2, 4, 1
So one way is to initilise the index 0 to arbitrary or null values and carry on from position
1 or to consider left=2i+1 and right=2i+2 as shown in the above piece of code.
